# Reflection 5 - How Data Science Advances Understand of Ourselves

Data science allows the easier collection, analysis, and identification of data and patterns that humans might not be able to see themselves. Data Science is able to do this through many different processes. There are many steps to data science and the analysis of data, however, there are 3 main steps in the analysis of data. First, data must be collected, often in vast sums larger than what a human could go through. Second, that data must be filtered and funneled into viable data. Raw data is often not useful, and as such will need to be sorted as aforementioned to be useful or identify patterns. Third, conclusions can be drawn through common factors, patterns, and models. Through these steps data science allows humans to analyze decisions and factors normally unseen. 

The collection of data in data science is able to be done at inhumane levels thanks to machine learning and the internet, as humans no longer have to go door to door for census or individual data. Data can be collected through thousands of different sources, from online sites, to mail, to cameras and location data. Everything about a person and their online presence can be categorized and sorted into large quantities, which would be near impossible for any human or group of humans to collect or later sort. In the future even more data could be collected through better technology or faster information inflow from surveys or location data, and with every millisecond of data collection saved, more time could be used in the computationally intense analysis and pattern recognition. Data science has expedited the process of data collection, and this sweeping data collection has allowed the next step to go from impossible to easy with the power of electronics and computers.

The second step, data analysis, is one of the most important and computationally intensive, but through modern technology and data science the process of data analysis and sorting is easily possible, and can compute more,faster with a single computer than with an entire human brain. By sorting and analyzing the vast sums of data and breakneck speeds, computational devices can find patterns that tens of humans would be unable to find with years of study. Through this, data science allows humans to understand their own patterns of behavior in economics, society, and general life. Data science sorting and pattern recognition allows disease spread like COVID-19 to be tracked and predicted, allows for the identification of potentially deadly diseases in people, and allows for infinitely more possibilities of identification of hidden patterns that humans might never see. Data science itself is simply mathematics and statistics coupled with seemingly infinitely large data sets and minisculely small patterns in that data. In the future it seems likely that with better computers and processing power data identification and sorting could be hugely expedited, allowing for far faster calculations and therefore a whole slew of new options. With more power more data could be analyzed, and the more data analyzed the more likely a pattern holds true. More data could be analyzed consecutively faster, and therefore more or smaller patterns could be found that could lead to incredibly useful information, such as if a disease might be wracking a certain area or if a certain type of person was more susceptible to disease or afflictions. 

The third step is more a human factor, and isnâ€™t as much involved in data science and machine learning, as the third step is about drawing conclusions from data. This step mainly helps humans as it allows ordinary people to understand sorted data and patterns. This can often be done through graphs, maps, or other such visual ideas. I believe that in the future it might be possible for the human factor to be either entirely removed or for humans to adapt to it. The first option I believe could happen through AI automatically understanding and presenting the data to humans, which would remove the human factor of understanding the analyzed data. The second option which I believe is possible though far in the future could be taking the patterns and then beaming it directly  into human minds which would be translated into understandable data to the human mind, which would involve a Neuralink-type idea with human minds being directly linked to pieces of technology which could wirelessly transmit information to the brain in a understandable format. This option seems very far-fetched though, and also might not be practical considering the expense to implement it versus the time saved by implementing the idea. 

Data science advances our understanding of ourselves and our hidden systems through analyzing countless unseen patterns in human behavior, through location, sex, age, and interests. These patterns can often lead to discoveries about humanity and individuals, and how we will act in certain groups. The advancement of data science advances human understanding, leading to a self-serving cycle of improvement and understanding. The uses of data science can be seen everywhere in every facet of life, and shines insight into the unknowns of human systems.
