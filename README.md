### Ball Graph


![](Ball)


This graph shows how far a ball travels in a matter of seconds. To create this graph, one must fist creat a x and y variable with numbers from 1-10 using the 
x <- 1:10
and
y <- 1:10 
commands. Next, graph it using the 
plot(x,y)
command. Then name the graph with the 
main = "..."
command, the x Label with the 
xlab = "..."
command, the y label with the 
ylab = "..."
command, and then just change the line length, color, dot shape, and dot size to fit personal preference.
