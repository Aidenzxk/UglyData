#### Ball Graph
![](Ball)
This graph shows how far a ball travels in a matter of seconds. TO create this graph, one must fist creat a x and y variable with numbers from 1-10 using the <div class="bg-gray p-5">
  <h3 class="text-shadow-light">.x <- 1:10</h3>
</div>x <- 1:10 and y <- 1:10 commands. Next, graph it using the plot(x,y) command. Then name the graph with the main = "..." command, the x Label with the xlab = "..." command, the y label with the ylab = "..." command, and then just change the line length,color, dot shape, and dot size to fit personal preference.
