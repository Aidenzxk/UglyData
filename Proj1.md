Overall I found this to be a little difficult to understand, especially once the more complicated graphs and overlays came into play. I feel that personally I didn't fully understand some of the ggplot commands or what they did, but I hope that with the completion of part 2 and future projects I will be able to fully understand the ggplot and its commands.
