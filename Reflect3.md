# Machine Learning in Youtube Reccomendations

Over 1 billion hours worth of video is watched every day on Youtube. Each of those videos is hand picked by an algorithm which learns based on klike videos and related groups. By taking your age, shown interests, location, and more, Youtube can personalize your content and find new content you might enjoy instantly. 

Youtube, and Google by extension uses a large machine learning network in order to find and suggest videos. Let’s say there are 100 videos to rank and suggest. Out of them, first Youtube will organize these by tags, such as gaming content or music. Next, youtube will compare these to current preferences known, so for example if a user enjoys Video Gaming content, Youtube will first select all the video gaming related content. Next, Youtube will sort those videos based on channels and type of content - ie. different video games. After the candidates have been chosen based on how well they compare to a user's preferences already, as well as the preferences in their age group and location, the algorithm will then rank the videos. In ranking the videos Youtube will also consider video features such as captions or video quality, as well as the number of views and whether the video is monetized. All these factors combine to rank and subsequently suggest videos on the platform. 

Once a user clicks on a video, the video will be put into their database of videos watched, and an algorithm will add ‘tags’ of the video to an algorithm to find better videos next time, narrowing down searches and videos. For example, if the user clicked on a new music video, the algorithm would see this and might begin to suggest similar songs, music genres, or artists. On the other hand, if a person didn’t watch much of a video or dislike it, the algorithm would set a negative rating for characteristics of the video, in the future suggesting less of the content. 

Lately the algorithm has not only been optimized to give recommendations, but also to keep viewers watching, especially for more ads. The end goal of this algorithm is not to find videos that are good or fun to watch, as that is subjective and changes with each person. Rather, the algorithms main purpose (along with increasing watch time) is to suggest videos that viewers would want to watch. This creates an addictive loop of specialized feedback as each video is hand picked to be interesting to watch and keep a viewer watching. 

Overall the algorithm is neither good nor bad, but it does what it is meant to and does it well. The addictive loop of videos gets viewers hooked on an endless stream of content and dopamine rush, and so as an algorithm and system of machine learning, it does a fine job. The system of getting recommendations over time has changed, and much of how the algorithm works is still unknown and kept secret, perhaps for fear of bad actors using the flaws in the system to get ‘unjust’ recommendations.
