# R Studio Path Graph

![](c65bb057-bc58-4e1a-95bc-375fcf9489a5)
To create this graph first create a graph with up to 100 spaces. Next, create a 2 lists, north and east, with 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. Then create different houses (square shapes) using those numbers as coordinates. Next create many different trees or obstacles using the number randomizer within the graph. Plot lines between the houses after compiling the locations in a single variable, and then use the xspline command to create a curve in the path through each location. (The picture shown has a path between 3 houses, not all 10 houses.)
