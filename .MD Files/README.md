Hello! I'm Aiden Weinhold, a current freshman at William and Mary. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, reading, and more. Currently I plan to major in computer science, but I'm not certain so I still might find something I can be passionate about. On this page I plan to do assignments for my Data Science Class. These assignments can be found in the links below. Welcome!
