# Project 3

### Team Challenge Question 1

This part went fine and I understood all of it pretty easily. This map shows all the provinces and sub provinces of Mongolia, I chose this map as I lived there for a time when I was quite young. 

### Stretch Goal 2

I had a little problem with this as I had set my alpha to 1 so I couldn't see the subdivisions of the province, but I figured it out. 
This map shows the most populous province of Mongolia and it's sub divisions.

### Stretch Goal 3

This one I had a lot more trouble with the boxes, as well as the fact that when I copied over the code I copied it over in the wrong order and some bits missing among other issues, but I finally fixed it. This graph shows 3 northern-most provinces of Mongolia, as well as the most populous provence, Övörhangay. The 3 northern-most provinces are Hövsgöl, Arhangay, and Bulgan.
