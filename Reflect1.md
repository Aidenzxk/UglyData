 ## Machine Learning in Healthcare
 
There are thousands of diseases around the world, each with its own symptoms and resulting problems. The problem is that some symptoms are so small or so hard to spot that even the best doctors cannot detect them. However, in recent years, machine learning has been used to detect these diseases quickly, often faster and with higher accuracy than trained medical professionals. Through machine learning, professionals can rely on software to accurately deduce afflictions, which could lead to expedited medical processes and more.
           
Recently with the Coronavirus pandemic machine learning has been used to quickly identify potential infectious people, both lessening the spread and damage the Coronavirus has done. One way this can be done is by using convolutional neural networks (CNN), as this type of network focuses on analyzing images as opposed to text or data. The CNN can then take electrocardiogram signals (ECG), which can show potential issues in a host, and compare them across others who have been confirmed to have the Coronavirus. After comparison the algorithm may be able to spot tells of the Coronavirus in someone, or lack of thereof. Another way that machine learning is used is by having thermal cameras set up that can process the temperatures of people. As Coronavirus carriers typically have a fever, a machine learning algorithm could detect individuals with higher than average temperatures and mark them down for testing or further analysis. As machine learning allows for vast comparisons and learning, an algorithm could detect fevers, coughing, or any other symptoms efficiently, and then compare it to those confirmed to have the coronavirus to find more carriers.
          
Efficiently diagnosing symptoms often can be the difference between life and death. Luckily, in the medical field precise records are kept of everything from diseases and their symptoms to treatments and other such data. Machine learning can use this data to both predict whether a person has a specific affliction, and possibly even find new cures using data gathered.  The data can be used in real time to find a patients ailment, by comparing previous patients symptoms, diseases, family medical records, and more. By comparing previous knowledge of infections and diseases to current symptoms, machine learning can often effectively and efficiently diagnose a patient correctly (given the correct code and data)  However, while machine learning may seem all good, there are a few dangerous pitfalls in machine learning.

One major flaw of machine learning is that it requires huge sums of data to be able to process and find solutions, as well as the fact that the data must be unbiased. Otherwise, biased data could lead to people of certain races, sexes, or economic status being discriminated against, and in healthcare discrimination can quickly lead to disease or death. Another flaw is that it takes a large amount of time and work to create the program, train it to spot disease or affliction, and have no biases or unseen errors. The costs of creating such a machine would be high, meaning money, time, and manpower would all have to be contributed in order to create a machine learning program of the said scope. Overall though, the potential benefits far outweigh the costs of creating such a system, if done right.
