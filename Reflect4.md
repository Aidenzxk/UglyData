# Data Collection in the Modern World

There are many different ways of data collection that companies use to enhance their machine learning algorithms. This can range from direct surveys to inferences through customer selections. Large quantities of data are often used in most large-scale machine learning algorithms, as the algorithm must go through thousands of products, pictures, videos, or other such items , and recommend the aforementioned products to potentially millions of customers. Data collection is a mostly unseen facet of machine learning, but is arguably one of the most important parts of the process. 

	One of the easiest ways of data collection is when users create a profile. A profile often includes age, location, and sex, which can often be used to sort users into demographics that typically share similar interests. Data can also be collected in this way through surveys or other such questionnaires where a company directly asks users about their interests, beliefs, and other such items. This form of data collection is often the easiest, though could yield false results from users who lie or don’t know for sure themselves. This is where the other forms of data collection come in. 

	One of the more prominent forms of data collection seen online is through cookies, which track browsing history, even when a user exits a site. This allows companies to see what content users enjoy or what they might potentially be interested in. Often this information is then sold to larger companies, who compile data sets of potential customers and create targeted ads or other such uses. Along with this companies can also look through social media use and company use such as reviews or how a user interacted with support to collect data on an individual. Companies can also track emails, being able to tell who opened emails and by what type of device. All this data is often used in both machine learning and user databases, but also to create targeted advertising per user and tracking the location and opinions of users. 

	After data is collected, it is often sold to large 3rd parties for mere pennies (or less) per person. These large companies will often collect the data, analyze and sort it into demographics and interests, and then sell the data to advertisers for targeted advertising. The system of collecting, sorting, and selling data often is gone unthought of in an age of online everything, however there are some dangers. A person’s data is essentially everything about them - their thoughts, activities, political beliefs, location, age, and far more. All this can be found with only a small amount of internet usage, as so many sites implement cookies, surveys, accounts, and more. This data could potentially be exploited or used in malicious ways.

	While the process of data collection seems malicious, just as most things in life it is neither good nor bad, and is only thought of as malicious due to bad actors. Data collection can be used to improve the lives of people, find symptoms of diseases, or finding items they might actually want, as opposed to targeted advertising. Data collection has the potential to be used for helping people rather than just being collected and sold like a meat market, but for that to happen someone will have to start the process of ethical data collection and sorting without divulging everything about a person.
