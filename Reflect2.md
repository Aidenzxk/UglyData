# Machine Learning in Baseball
While at first baseball may seem like a purely physical sport with no hidden intricacies or subterfuges, in reality these strategies and signals are used throughout the whole game, which often can lead to an easier victory. Of course, the subterfuge I refer to is the art of hand signals - telling a player to stay or steal, or a pitcher to throw the ball a certain way. These signals are often a sequence of seemingly random signs, such as touching the face, arms, hat, or chest in a certain order. Often these sequences cannot be decoded by the human brain, as without knowing the proper tell or command, it would be near impossible to correlate causes and actions accurately. Youtuber Mark Rober decided to find a better way of finding these sequences, and teamed up with data scientist Jabril to create an app capable of analyzing and categorizing different tells to find an accurate outcome.

To do this, the team utilized machine learning to understand the data. Machine learning works by looking at positive and negative data, and finds certain data within that range. For example, to find a persons favorite food types, the person's likes and dislikes could be inputted into the system, and the machine could then create ideas of what the person likes and dislikes. Then the machine learning could begin to compare the values of things the person likes to things that share the same value, say garlic bread and cheesy garlic bread. In learning baseball signs, the machine will take all the data available about each tell, and find a common pattern. For example, if a coach touched body parts in a sequence of events, say arm,chest, nose, lips, arm, and chest, and the athlete stole a base, the machine learning algorithm could assign values to each of those actions, like a,b,c,d,a,b , the algorithm could compare it to other algorithms and find similarities which would show whether or not the coach wanted a player to steal or pitch a certain way. 

Many coaches have an indicator, followed by a sign which would tell a player what to do. For a human this might be impossible as there might be 20 signs in a random order, with the indicator and following sign being among them. However, a machine can take every set of input and compare them, getting closer and closer to an input that would have a 100% rate of an action occurring, say a base being stolen. Using this info, Mark Rober and Jabril created a program that would require manual inputs of what the coach would do, and in what order, as well as the result of the chain of signs. After a few iterations, the machine learning algorithm could start to see patterns that appear when an outcome happens, and start looking for that. Once the algorithm is trained as to what is a success and what is a failure (steal/no steal, etc.) it can begin to look at all of the values given to find patterns that adhere to previous patterns and result combinations.

While the idea of the app could help coaches decode other coaches signals, allowing them to know whether opposing teams will steal or hit in a certain way, it most likely wonâ€™t be implemented. Even though it is encouraged to guess or notice a sequence and result, with technology the skill goes away, and no human can beat a neural network of machine learning capable of doing thousands of comparisons a second. Therefore, even though the app and idea could be useful, by principle alone many coaches most likely will not ever use it, as it would be considered highly unsportsmanlike conduct and would probably go against most coaches beliefs and moral compass.
